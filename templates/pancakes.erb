<p>My name is <%= u.name %>, and I'm a <%= u.city %> native and <span class="highlighted js-define" title="Self-Description">pancake lover</span>. I'm writing to apply for the position of <span class="highlighted js-define" title="">Flapjack Flipper</span> at <span class="highlighted js-define" title="Their Business Name">Company Name, Inc.</span>. The position first caught my eye when <span class="highlighted js-define" title="Position Reference">the scent of maple syrup wafted out of the kitchen</span>, although I'd heard of <span class="highlighted js-define" title="Their Business Name">Company Name, Inc.</span> long before that.</p>
<p>As I read through the job description for the first time, I realized what a great fit this position would be. <span class="highlighted js-define" title="Their Business Name">Company Name, Inc.</span>'s mission strikes a personal chord; <span class="highlighted js-define" title="Personal Chord">my entire family has worked in the pancake business, and I want to work for a company that strives to be the best breakfast-based business around.</span></p>
<p>As for my qualifications, <span class="highlighted js-define" title="Qualification #1">I got my culinary degree from the Lumberjack School of Pancake Arts.</span> <span class="highlighted js-define" title="Qualification #2">I have a hearty stomach and I can eat many pounds of pancake in one sitting.</span> In particular, I'm looking for an environment that <span class="highlighted js-define" title="Environment Fit">promotes the usage of cutting-edge spatula techniques</span>, and I think <span class="highlighted js-define" title="Their Business Name">Company Name, Inc.</span> may be the perfect opportunity to do just that.</p>
<p>Thanks for your time. I'll be in touch soon to follow up, but I can be reached anytime by email at <%= u.email %>, or by phone at <%= u.phone %>.</p>
